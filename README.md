# MathCloudJS
This is a game that I have created with HTML/CSS/JavaScript to help children learn their multiplication table from 0x0 to 12x12 through the process of repetitive learning. The game is browser based and is written in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The player will be given a set of clouds with the multiplication question and a raindrop with the answer included. The user will then load and fire the raindrop into the cloud in question, from which the system will prompt if the user has correctly selected the answer or if the answer is wrong and allow the user to try again if they wish.
